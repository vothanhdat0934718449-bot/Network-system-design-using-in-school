# Network System Design for School

## Project Description
This project focuses on designing and simulating a computer network system for a school environment using Cisco Packet Tracer.

## Overview
The network is designed to support basic school operations, including administration, classrooms, and internal services, with logical segmentation and secure access.

## Objectives
- Design a structured and scalable network topology
- Implement VLAN segmentation and routing
- Apply basic network security mechanisms
- Practice network simulation using Cisco Packet Tracer

## Results
- A functional school network topology was successfully designed
- Devices can communicate according to the defined network rules
- Network access is secured with authentication mechanisms
